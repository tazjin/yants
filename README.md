**YANTS** is Yet Another Nix Type System.

Its code **has moved** to `//depot/nix/yants` on [git.tazj.in][]. At this point
most of my software (unless it lives in other organisations) is no longer
developed on GitHub.

If you are looking for an issue tracker, issues and patches for my projects are
tracked at [depot@tazj.in][] (which is also the email address that you can send
issues and patches to).
